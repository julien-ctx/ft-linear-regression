# Linear Regression | 42

 ðŸ“ˆ An implementation of a simple linear regression with a single feature.

## An introduction to machine learning

The purpose of this project is simple: we have to **predict the price of a vehicle depending of its mileage**. To do so, we have to:

- **Normalize** all the data to avoid any overflow in the following steps.
- Perform **gradient descent algorithm** with Î¸ values initialized at 0.
- Use final Î¸ to predict the data on Y, with X provided by the user.

In addition, we can plot the **linear regression** line on the coordinate system to visualize data trend.
A **loss curve** can also be generated with every Î¸ tested when performing the gradient descent algorithm.
